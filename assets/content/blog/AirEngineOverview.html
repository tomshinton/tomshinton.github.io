            <div class=contentTitle>An Introduction to the AirEngine</div>
            <div class=content>
AirEngine is a modified deployment of Unreal Engine 4.26.1 that is constantly in development.

I have a philosophy when it comes to development - if I've found myself repeating the same implementation in more than one project, then the implementation is liable for an engine addition.
                
The bulk of these features/changes are RTS oriented, but there's a whole bunch of UI, Utility and Networking features too.

A lot of the code's hacky, a lot of it is probably not as performant as it could be- but that's ok! Development is iterative.  If some of this code puts the frametime in the toilet, i'll revise the code, no harm no foul.
                
<strong><i>Why no pull requests?</i></strong>
                
I earnestly believe these features are experimental, the result of "I should probably add this to the engine", and as such, I wouldn’t consider them "must-have" for the vanilla Unreal Engine deployment.  Not every game needs a World Grid, yanno?  As such, <i>please feel free</i> to yoink any code you find on this blog and integrate it to your local builds, and please give me poke or tweet if you make anything cool with it.
                
<strong><i>Could these be plugins?</i></strong>
                
Yep! Absolutely.  These changes have been integrated into the Engine simply because ill almost certainly forget to download my own plugins at some point.  Similarly, a lot of these changes, such as the networked Cheat Manager, could be integrated in a game-specific class - I've moved them to the engine so I don’t have to bother with a bloated class.  I just want cheats in my cheat managers.

<strong><i>Why document this?</i></strong>

I realised that a signficant chunk of my time was spent <i>GOOGLING</i> how this sort of stuff is done, and found there aint a great deal of resources out there, especially if you just want to play around outside the usual realm of engine modification.  I felt it was time I gave back to the developer community.
