            <div class=content>
AirEngine is a modified deployment of Unreal Engine 4.26.1 that is constantly in development.

I have a philosophy when it comes to development - if I've found myself repeating the same implementation in more than one project, then the implementation is liable for an engine addition.
                
The bulk of these features/changes are RTS oriented, but there's a whole bunch of UI, Utility and Networking features too.

A lot of the code's hacky, a lot of it is probably not as performant as it could be- but that's ok! Development is iterative.  If some of this code puts the frametime in the toilet, i'll revise the code, no harm no foul.
